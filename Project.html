    <p>
      These days, much of the conversation around women in coding revolves
      around their disproportionate representation in the field.<em>
        Many organizations and coding schools working to increase the number
        of women working in tech.</em>
      <br />
      Women currently hold <strong>25%</strong> of coding jobs and earn
      <strong>30%</strong> less money than men. ðŸ’»<span>SheCodes</span> is
      here to help bridge the gender gap in the tech programming industry by
      providing knowledge that is becoming necessary in todayâ€™s increasingly
      technological job market.
